# Battleship

This implementation of [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) was created to practice the web development concepts that I learned from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/battleship).
<br>

The game can be played by a single player against the computer.
